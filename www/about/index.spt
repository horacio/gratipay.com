    <p>You've found Gratipay!</p>

    <p>Gratipay (formerly Gittip) is a way to give money every week to people
    and teams you believe in.</p>

    <p>Payments are <b>weekly</b>. Bills are recurring. Therefore, income from
    Gratipay is recurring.</p>

    <p>Payments come with <b>no strings attached</b>. You don't know exactly
    who is paying you, and payments are capped at $100/wk to individuals and
    $1,000/wk to organizations, to dampen undue influence.</p>

    <p>Payments are <b>public</b>. By default, the <i>total</i> amount you give
    and the <i>total</i> amount you receive is public (you can opt out of
    sharing this info).</p>
